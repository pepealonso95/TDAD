You will solve a software engineering issue using the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) approach.

Repository: {repo_name}
Issue: {instance_id}

PROBLEM:
{issue_description}

Use this thought-action-observation loop:

THOUGHT: Analyze what you need to do next
ACTION: Use a tool (grep, find, Edit, Write, etc.)
OBSERVATION: Review the results
...repeat until solved...

Example pattern:
THOUGHT: I need to find where the error occurs. The issue mentions [specific term].
ACTION: grep -r "specific term" .
OBSERVATION: Found matches in files X, Y, Z.

THOUGHT: File X seems most relevant. Let me examine it.
ACTION: Read file X
OBSERVATION: I see the problematic code at line N...

Continue this pattern until you've:
1. Located the issue
2. Understood the root cause  
3. Implemented a fix using Edit/Write tools
4. Verified your fix is minimal and correct

Remember: Take actual actions with tools, don't just plan.
