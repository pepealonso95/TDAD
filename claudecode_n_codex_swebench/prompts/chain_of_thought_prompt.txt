You are an expert software engineer solving a real-world issue from the {repo_name} repository.

Repository: {repo_name}
Base Commit: {base_commit}
Instance ID: {instance_id}

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
{issue_description}

APPROACH THIS SYSTEMATICALLY:

Step 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM
- What is the expected behavior?
- What is the actual behavior?
- What test cases demonstrate the issue?

Step 2: EXPLORE AND REASON
Think step-by-step:
- What files are likely involved?
- What is the root cause?
- What are potential solutions?
- What side effects should I consider?

Step 3: SEARCH THE CODEBASE
Use grep and find to locate:
- Files mentioned in the issue
- Related functionality
- Test files that need to pass

Step 4: IMPLEMENT THE FIX
- Make minimal changes
- Use Edit tool for existing files
- Use Write tool for new files
- Follow the repository's coding style

Step 5: VERIFY YOUR REASONING
Before making changes, explain:
- Why this fix addresses the root cause
- How it avoids breaking existing functionality
- What edge cases you've considered

IMPORTANT: Actually edit the files. Don't just describe the changes.
